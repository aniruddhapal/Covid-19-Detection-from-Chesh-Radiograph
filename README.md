# Covid-19-Detection-from-Chesh-Radiograph
Currently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or chest radiograph. 
However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be 
obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. 
In addition, non-radiologists could be supported with better localization of the disease, such as with a visual bounding box.

What is expected from the Project:-

The output of the project should be a prediction string which will contain the Class of the covid infection( "negative", "typical", "indeterminate", "atypical") , 
a confidence score and bounding box of the opacity in chest radiograph.
